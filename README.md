# ðŸ“¦ Repo size - homemade

### How to use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Generate a Github classic token with `repo` permissions.
3. Paste that token in the input and click 'Store'
4. Build it and load as temporary extension in your Firefox based browser of choice.
5. Buy this good boy a coffee :)

### Considerations

Maybe I'll improve this, maybe I won't. Haven't decided that yet.

### Shout-outs

Kudos to [@harshjv](https://github.com/harshjv) for his [github-repo-size](https://github.com/harshjv/github-repo-size), which served for inspiration to make this humble thing.
His addon is probably better than this, it's just that I'm going through a no-third-party phase.

The human-readable size function was shamelessly copied from [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14919494).
